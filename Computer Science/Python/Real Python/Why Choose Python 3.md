**Python** is a high-level, interpreted scripting language developed in the late 1980 by Guido van Rossum at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands. The initial version was published in 1991 and version 1.0 was released in 1994

Python 2.0 was released in 2000, and the 2.x versions were the prevalent releases until December 2008. At the time, the development team made the decision to release version 3.0 which contained a few relatively small but significant changes that were not backward compatible with 2.x versions. As of January 1, 2020 Python 2 is no longer being maintained so it is recommended that you focus on Python 3.

Python is still maintained by a core development team at the Institute, and Guido is still in change, having been given the title of BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life) by the Python community. The name Python derives, not form the snake, but from the British comedy troupe Monty Python's Flying Circus, of which Guido is a fan of. It is common to find references to Monty Python sketches and movies scattered throughout the Python documentation.

# Why Choose Python? 

## Python is Popular
The 2022 Stack Overflow Developer Survey ranked Python as the 4th most popular and the number one most wanted technology of the year tied with Rust. World-class software development companies around the globe use Python every single day, below are a few notable names:
-  Google
- Facebook
- Instagram
- Spotify
- Quora
- Netflix
- Dropbox
- Reddit  

 Due to the popularity and widespread use of Python as a programming language Python developers are sought after and paid well.  

## Python is Interpreted
Many languages are compiled, meaning the source code you create needs to be translated into machine code, the language of your computer's processor, before it can be run. Programs written in interpreted languages are passed straight to an interpreter that runs them directly, this leads to a quicker development cycle since there is no compilation step.  

One potential downside to interpreted languages is execution speed. Program that are compiled into the native language of the computer processor tend to run faster than interpreted programs. For applications that are particularly computationally intensive, like graphics processing or intense number crunching, this can be limiting.

In practice, however, the difference in execution speeds is measured in milliseconds, or seconds at most and not appreciable noticeable to human users. The expediency of coding in an interpreted language is typically worth it for most applications.

## Python is Free
The Python interpreter is developed under an OSI-approved open-source license, making it free to install, use, and distribute, even for commercial purposes.

## Python is Portable
Because Python code is interpreted and not compiled into native machine instructions, code written for one platform will work on any other platform that has the Python interpreter installed. (True for any interpreted language, not just Python.)

## Python is Simple
Python is relatively uncluttered, and the developers have deliberately kept it that way. 

A rough estimate of complexity of a language can be gleaned from the number of keywords in the language. Python 3 has 33 keywords, Python 2 has 31. By contrast, C++ has 62, Java has 53, and Visual Basic has more than 120. 

Python code has a simple and clean structure that is easy to learn and easy to read. In fact, the language definition enforces code structure that is easy to read.

## But It's Not That Simple
For all its syntactical simplicity, Python supports most constructs that would be expected in a very high-level language, including complex dynamic data types, structured and [[Functional Programming|function programming]], and [[Object Oriented Programming|object-oriented programming]].

Additionally, a very extensive library of classes and functions is available that provides capability well beyond what is built into the language, such as database manipulation and GUI programming.

Python accomplishes what many programming languages don't: the language itself is simply designed, but it is very versatile in terms of what you can accomplish with it.
