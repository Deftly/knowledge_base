Of all the *standard* editors on a Unix system, vi is the most useful one to master. Unlike Emacs, it is available in nearly identical form on every modern Unix system, thus providing a kind of text-editing *lingua franca*.  

vi exists in multiple incarnations. There is the original Unix version, and multiple "clones": programs written from scratch to behave as vi does, but not based on the original vi source code. Of these, Vim has become the most popular.

Initially, vi looks unintuitive and cumbersome however once you start learning you'll realize you only need a few keystrokes to do complex tasks. The shortcuts you learn will transfer more and more of the editing work to the computer -- where it belongs.

vi and Vim are not "what you see if what you get" word processors. If you want to produce formatted documents, you must type in specific instructions(sometimes called *formatting codes*) that are used by a separate formatting program to control the appearance of the printed copy. Formatting codes are specific verbs in what are more generally know as *markup languages*.
