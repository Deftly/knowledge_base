This is a day of affirmation, a celebration of liberty. We stand here in the name of freedom. At the heart of that western freedom and democracy is the belief that the individual man, a child of god, is the touchstone of value and all society, and all groups, and states exist for that person's benefit. 

Everything that makes man's life worthwhile - family, work, education, a place to rear one's children and a place to rest one's head - all can be swept away by a government which does not heed the demands of its people. Not just to the wealthy; not just to those of a particular religion; not just to those of a particular race; but to all of the people.

Everywhere new technology and communications bring men and nations closer together, the concerns of one inevitable become the concerns of all. And our new closeness is stripping away the false masks, the illusion of differences which is the root of injustice and of hat and of war. 

This world demands the qualities of youth: not a time of life but a state of mind, a tempter of the will, a quality of the imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the life of ease. Those with the courage to enter the conflict will find themselves with companions in every corner of the world.

It would be a world which demanded of each government that it accept its responsibility to insure social justice. It would be a world of constantly accelerating economic progress - not material welfare as an end in of itself, but as a means to liberate the capacity of every human being to pursue his talents and to pursue his hopes. It would, in short, be a world that we would all be proud to have built. 

We must do this, not because it is economically advantageous - although it is; not because the laws of God command it - although they do. We must do it for the single and fundamental reason that it is the right thing to do. Moral courage is rarer commodity than bravery in battle or great intelligence. Yet it is the one essential, vital quality for those who seek to change the world which yields most painfully to change. 

Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls oppression and resistance. 

Few will have the greatness to bend history; but each of use can work to change a small portion of the events, and in the total of all these will be written in the history of this generation.
