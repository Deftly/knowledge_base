> It's a common misconception that meeting protein needs is challenging for vegetarians. Here we'll review the importance of protein, how much we need, and how to get enough. 

# Functions of protein
Protein is one of three macronutrients, alongside carbohydrates and [[Fats and Oils |fats]] . It's a source of energy that has important structural and functional responsibilities in the body. Here are a of the roles proteins play:
- **Structure:** proteins such as collagen and keratin play a structural role in muscles and other tissues.
- **Hormones:** proteins can act as chemical messengers to transmit signals, such as insulin.
- **Transportation:** proteins help with transportation throughout the body. For example, hemoglobin is a protein that carries oxygen from the lungs to body tissues.
- **Immune defense:** antibodies and immunoglobulins are proteins that protect the immune system.
- **Enzymes:** proteins that help speed up chemical reactions in the body and partake in several metabolic processes.  

# The building blocks of protein
Protein is a large structure made up of smaller building blocks called [[Amino Acids|amino acids]]. There are twenty amino acids that the body needs, eleven of which are "non-essential" and nine which are "essential".
- **"Non-essential" amino acids** mean that our bodies can make them on their own. Due to this, seeking food sources rich in these amino acids isn't necessary.
- **"Essential" amino acids** mean that our bodies cannot make them, so we need to consume them from food sources. The nine essential amino acids include histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine.

# Protein requirements

## Quantity of protein
How much protein we need depends on several factors including age, body composition, activity level, health status, presence of illnesses, and so on. Plant-based proteins may not be as efficiently absorbed in the body but the difference is quite small.

The protein requirements for an average adult is **0.8 g/kg - 1.0 g/kg** of body weight. For example, if someone weights 143 lbs (65 kg), then their minimum estimated protein needs would be 52-65 g per day.

## A note on athletes
Another common misconception is that *all* people who exercise require a high protein intake. It's true that athletes who train at an elite level have higher requirements at about **1.2-2.0 g/kg** of body weight. For the average adult who exercises recreationally(30 minutes several times a week) **0.8-1.0 g** of protein per kg of body weight is enough to meet needs.

## Other populations to consider
Protein requirements are also higher for young children, elderly populations, and pregnant individuals. It's best to consult a dietitian for personalized nutrition requirements.

# Food sources
Protein is found in a wide variety of legumes, grains, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Below is a list of just a few top sources with approximate grams of protein per serving.

## Legumes
- **Tempe** (1/2 cup) - 17 g 
- **Tofu** (1/2 cup) - 13 g 
- **Edamame** (1/2 cup) - 9 g 
- **Most bean varieties** (1/2 cup) - 8 g 

## Grains
- **Rolled oats, uncooked**, (1/2 cup) - 5 g
- **Quinoa, cooked** (1/2 cup) - 4 g

## Nuts and seeds
- **Hemp seeds** (1/4 cup) - 13 g
- **Pumpkin seeds** (1/4 cup) - 11 g
- **Peanuts** (1/4 cup) - 9 g
- **Chia seeds** (1/4 cup) - 8 g
- **Peanut butter** (2 tbsp) - 8 g
- **Almond butter** (2 tbsp) - 7 g
- **Tahini** (2 tbsp) - 5 g

## Vegetables
- **Green peas, cooked** (1 cup) - 8 g
- **Artichoke, cooked** (1 cup) - 5 g
- **Spinach, cooked** (1 cup) - 5 g

## Plant-based milk products
- **Soy yogurt** (3/4 cup) - 6 g 
- **Soy milk** (1 cup) - 6 g 

**Pro tip:** soy milk is often recommended because it provides protein similar to cow's milk, whereas other plant-based milk don't offer this much protein.

# Complimentary proteins
As mentioned earlier, there are nine essential amino acids that we need to get from foods. This is where the quality of protein comes into play. If a food item contains all nine amino acids in sufficient amounts it's called a "complete protein". Soy is the main plant-based source of complete protein. Other plant based protein sources are lower in a few essential amino acids, namely *lysine* and *methionine*.  

For example, most grains tend to be high in methionine but low in lysine, while most legumes tend to be high in lysine but low in methionine. This is where the idea of protein combining emerged. Incorporating "complementary" proteins throughout the day "make up" for the lack of particular amino acids in the other food group. By consistently consuming a varied diet from all food groups, we'll likely have our bases covered.

Many commonly eaten foods are already complementary, for example:
- Toast with nut butter
- Hummus with pita bread or whole-grain crackers
- Rice and beans, in a nourish bowl, wrap, or taco
- Stir fry with tofu or edamame served over rice or with noodles

# Supplementation & protein powders
It is absolutely possible to obtain adequate levels from food alone even as an athlete. If our requirements have been determined to be very high or we're unable to meet our needs from food alone we may choose to supplement with a powder. Some plant-based sources include soy protein, pea protein, hemp protein, flax protein, chia protein, and brown rice protein. When looking to purchase protein powders we can try to aim for brands that aren't heavily sweetened and have been assess for contaminants.

In Canada, for example, once a department of the government has assessed a product and decided it's safe and of high quality, it issues a product licence along with an eight-digit Natural Product Number (NPN), which must appear on the label. It may be worthwhile to see if your local government has similar regulations and if a brand meets those regulations it may be one to consider.
