5. Dot the yogurt with the stewed berries and use a butter knife to swirl.
6. Place into the freezer and let it freeze for 1-2 hours, or until the bars are solid enough to cut.

8. Let them thaw for 3-5 minutes before enjoying.


### Storage
Store in an airtight container in the freezer for up to 3 weeks, with parchment paper between cut slices of the bars to prevent them from sticking to each other.
